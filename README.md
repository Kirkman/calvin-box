What if Calvin had _two_ cardboard boxes?

This texmode animation was released in the [Mistrigris](https://mistigris.org/)/[Break Into Chat](https://breakintochat.com) "[IGNITE01](https://breakintochat.com/blog/2024/12/31/ignite-the-first-all-igs-artpack/)" artpack. Artwork and code by Kirkman (Josh Renaud).

This repo contains the code I used to produce a 3-minute "Calvin and Hobbes"-themed animation in IGS, or "[Instant Graphics and Sound](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Instant_Graphics_and_Sound_(IGS))," format on my Synchronet BBS.

This animation runs in Synchronet BBS software's Javascript environment, and requires my own [igs.js](https://github.com/Kirkman/sync-igs.js) and [helper-functions.js](https://github.com/Kirkman/sync-helper-functions.js) libraries.

To actually see this animation run live on the BBS, you need to connect to the BBS using the IGS software on an Atari ST computer, or in an Atari ST emulator. 

Otherwise, you can watch a video of the [Calvin animation](https://vimeo.com/1042197200/f4ed38cc26?share=copy), or a [video of the entire IGNITE artpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS_riObN32o).
